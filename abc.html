Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, who is still the head of the company at the time. Based in Seattle, Amazon started out as an online bookseller and went on to become the world 's largest non-travel e-commerce business. Once the website was established as a bookseller, it was a logical step into the sale of other entertainment products, such as music and films, and also into the hardware used to deliver home entertainment.


Amazon was a pioneer in the use of software that monitors each online customer 's preferences, enabling the company to suggest other products that may be of interest to the individual, either on their personalized web page or via e-mail. A book customer who walks out of a bookshop, with or without a purchased book, is effectively `lost ' to the store, but Amazon can target registered customers — with their permission — with messages such as `Recommended for you ' or `Customers who bought this item also bought '.
